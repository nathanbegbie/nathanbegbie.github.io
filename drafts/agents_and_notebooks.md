## A Reflections on Notebooks and Agents

I've been using this approach since about the start of the year and it's worked well for me.
However, this was prior to the advent of Claude Code and other agentic coding processes.
This approach really lends itself to when _I'm_ the one doing most of the thinking and processing, handing off smaller one-off tasks like remembering `pandas` syntax in one-line requests.
The REPL environment doesn't work so well with Claude Code becuase it doesn't run the cells - it's conventionally used to running things as fully fledged scripts from the CLI.
In some cases, this lends itself well to software development practices - if you want to understand the code, break it down in to testable pieces and run those tests.
However, it's not doing such a great job of _my_ understanding, which notebooks are ideally placed for.
The whole notion of gradually building my understanding of a concept or API is steamrolled by a very helpful agent, so if I do want to ensure that I'm understanding this at a conceptual level, then this approach is the one that I'd go for, over an agent.

So, while I think that notebooks as a programming enviornment have their drawbacks, they are exceptionally placed to put the intended audience first.
