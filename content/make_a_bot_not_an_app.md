Title: Build a Chat Bot, Not an App

One of the questions that I'm often asked is whether an app idea is a good one.
Most often, the answer is no. Not becuase of the idea itself, but because the person asking is the one who plans to build it.
It's crucial that you get validation of your idea as quickly as possible.
While a lot of people think that the app _is_ the idea, it's not.
A lot of the time, a mobile application is an interface to that idea.
They way I explain this to people is to ask them to imagine if they could implement their desired functionailty using a bot, rather than an app.
It's usually possible, particularly if the idea involves a lot of backend processes anyway.

It's not a panacea.
Bots can be frustrating and in some cases, a poor user experience depending on the use case.
However, there are two big arguments in favour of using them.

## Building Apps is Expensive

Both in terms of time and monetary value, there are a number of hurdles when building mobile applications.
Have you done this before? If not, then you face the choice to bild it yourself, possibly in two languages or one, as well as understanding the two frameworks and the app store publishing process.
If you want someone else to build it, expect to fork out some cash. Even when outsourcing the development, the end product will not be instantaneuous.
Ideally, when seeking to validate an idea, you want something fast and cheap.
However, even if you were able to build an app yourself, or withing budget and on time, you face another hurdle.

## No-one Wants to Download Your App

Once you have the app published on the app store, you need to people to download it.
You're going to need to think about a marketing strategy so that people both know about and want to get your app.
In low-income settings, does someone have the mobile data to spend on downloading something they may not like?
How will you get your app to get noticed within the app stores?
Getting someone to engage in your product or idea often costs someone something - even if it is just their momentary attention.
Ideally, you need to reduce that cost as close to zero as possible.

Here's why bots might just be the better initial approach;

## Bots are a Cheap Way to Prototype

## Initiating a Conversation is Easy

In contrast to downloading an app, starting a conversation with a chatbot is easy, particularly if you can use a URL in a message or scan a Bar Code.
All it takes is a message.
At any time, you can block, delete or simply stop the conversation.

## What I'm Not Saying

I'd like to be clear about a couple of points here.

-   Bots are not always superior to mobile apps - they're not. Often, you can provide a richer,
-   Bots do not always simplify an experience - try filling in an airlines check-in via Telegram, and you will soon long for even the most unweildy web form
-   Bots are always cheaper than mobile apps - start-up costs are much loewr for bots. However, in a production setting, you still need to run your service somewhere, there will be a backend system that needs maintenance. Providers like WhatsApp often involved a monthly flat fee in addition to providers. So while you might not
-   A bot is a bot is a bot - setting up a bot on Telegram versus WhatsApp as a business is a _very_ different process. Telegram involves a straightforward setup. WhatsApp involves verifying your business and getting approval to operate.
-   It's either/or when it comes to these technologies - if you can afford to, these technologies can complement each other really well. You could provide the service via chat, and if a use-case gets complicated, encourage them to download the app. You're already talking to a user who hopefully values your product or service.
